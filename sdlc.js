// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The second step, in which an analysis of the requirments of the software take place to determine what is needed of the software and what is needed to produce it."
const design = "The third step, in which the software gets designed to prepare for the implementation phase."
const implementation =  "The fourth step, in which the programming of the software takes place."
const testingAndIntegration = "The fifth step, in which the software is tested for quality assurance/bugs and made sure it can be used by the end user."
const maintain = "The sixth step, in which the software is mainted for use after release, this involes fixing issues or changing the software to user needs."
